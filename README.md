# TicTacToeConsole 

A fun console driven version of the classic game, built in a modular way to convert to GUI later.

## Instructions:
To run, type the command `javac TicTacToeConsole.java` in the terminal (also called console or command line) and press enter. Next type `java TicTacToe` in the terminal and press enter. Program will load up and you are ready to play!

 The board is broken into a 3 x 3 grid and you enter numeric values for your turn using the following layout:

 > 1 1 | 1 2 | 1 3
 >
 > 2 1 | 2 2 | 2 3
 >
 > 3 1 | 3 2 | 3 3

 For example, to take the center square on your turn, type: `2 2` and press enter.

 # TicTacToe GUI version

 ## Instructions: 
 To run, type `javac TicTacToe.java` in the terminal and press enter. Next type `java TicTacToe` and press enter. The program should now load the introduction screen, and just follow the onscreen prompts to get started!
