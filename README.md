# TicTacToeConsole

A fun console driven version of the classic game, built in a modular way to convert to GUI later.

## Instructions:

 The board is broken into a 3 x 3 grid and you enter numeric values for your turn using the following layout:

 > 1 1 | 1 2 | 1 3
 >
 > 2 1 | 2 2 | 2 3
 >
 > 3 1 | 3 2 | 3 3

 For example, to take the center square on your turn, type: `2 2` and press enter.
